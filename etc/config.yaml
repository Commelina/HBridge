# 3. connectType: Type of connection of this broker. It can be one of MQTTConnection and TCPConnection.
# 4. brokerSubs: Topic list which the broker subscribes. Only messages with matched topic will be forwarded to this broker.
# 5. brokerFwds: Topic list which the broker forwards. Only messages with matched topic will be sent from this broker to the bridge.
